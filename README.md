# Neural Network
In order to run this neural network you have to use the following command:
` $ python neuralNetwork.py <command> `

## Comands
The following commands are available:

###  - help  
This command is used to get a help message.
  
###  - train  
With this command you can train the neural network.

###  - gui  
This command is used to get a graphical user interface.
With this gui you can draw your own images
and let the neural network recognise them.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This command should only be used after the neural network has been trained.

###  - run  
With this command you can run the neural network.
This command has a second optional command.
If you want to run another image through the neural network
then the one specified in the settings,
